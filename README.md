### Hello world 

👋 Welcome to my GitHub account!

😄 My pronouns are she/her/hers.

🏫 I am a PhD student at Northwestern University. I completed my undergraduate studies in computer science at the University of Illinois in May 2022.

🌱 I’m curious about how technology can be used to support students learning computer science.
