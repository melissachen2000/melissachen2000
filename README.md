### Hello world 

👋 Welcome to my GitHub account!

😄 My pronouns are she/her/hers.

🏫 I am a senior studying computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a minor in math. 

🔭 Last year, I was working on creating educational resources and activities with an awesome co-chair and committee. Some of our work is available at [Illinois WCS Explorations](http://wcs.illinois.edu/explorations/index.html). I have since moved into a new position where I'm focused on feedback mechanisms, inclusion, and improving the member experience at [Illinois WCS Growth](https://go.illinoiswcs.org/growth-home).

💻 I'm also working with Girls Who Code @ UIUC to plan curriculum for outreach workshops!

🌱 I’m currently learning about supporting individual and collaborative learning and working.
