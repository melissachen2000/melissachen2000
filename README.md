### Hello there! 

😄 My name is Melissa (she/her) and I am a PhD student at Northwestern University. My research is on how to design sociotechnical systems to support students in making accurate judgements about their programming ability to support their self-efficacy and motivation.

🎓 I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2022 with a degree in computer science. I also minored in math.
